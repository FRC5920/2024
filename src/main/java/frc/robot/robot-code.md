### Robot Code

The primary robot code is centered on a small group of modules located under the
[src/main/java/frc/robot/](./) directory:

- [Constants.java](./Constants.java) - common constants shared by robot code modules.
- [Main.java](./Main.java) - execution entry point for the robot (minimal boilerplate code)
- [Robot.java](./Robot.java) - top-level routines used
to initialize the robot and execute periodic functions for teleop, autonomous,
test, and simulation.
- [RobotContainer.java](./RobotContainer.java) - a class
that contains the instances of all robot subsystems.

These modules are supplemented and aided by
[support library (/lib)](../lib/support-library.md) classes and packages and
modules organized under the following subdirectories:

| Subdirectory | Description |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| autos        | Classes used to implement autonomous routines and an associated dashboard tab |
| commands     | Command classes used to carry out robot functions |
| subsystems   | Classes that implement robot subsystems (drivebase, intake, etc.)
