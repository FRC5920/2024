# Links For Learning Basic Java Programming

The code for the VIKotics robot is all written in Java, an object-oriented programming language.
This document is intended for those who are new to programming in Java or who want to review the
basic elements of Java programming.

There are many free Java programming tutorials available on the web.  One of these is a website
called [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com), which hosts tutorials and resources for a variety
of programming languages.  To help new programmers on the team quickly come up to speed and begin
writing Java code for the robot, this document provides a curated list of several of the w3schools
Java tutorials and some associated exercises.  These tutorials were chosen because they focus on the
basic, fundamental elements of the Java programming language that must be understood to begin
writing code.

The last couple of tutorials on this page provide a brief introduction to concepts of
object-oriented programming: a style of programming that provides structure and reuse, and is used
extensively in FIRST robotics code.  This is a topic that builds upon the basic Java programming
elements, but requires more explanation than is provided here to properly understand and use.

On your own time and at your own pace, please read through the tutorials and ***Do the practice problems!***

All material linked to here is free and requires only a web browser with internet access.  If you
have trouble understanding something, bring your questions to a coding mentor or... even better:
bring them to robotics practice!  Odds are: you're probably not the only one with questions and the
rest of the programming team may benefit from learning the answers.

Don't forget: learning to program is *literally* learning a new language and that's something that
takes **time** and **practice**.  Take a deep breath.  Give yourself some grace.  Smile and try
again!  You can do this.

## Java Programming Tutorials

### Concept: Java Variables (used to store values)

#### Tutorials:

- [Declaring Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp)
- [Printing Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables_print.asp) (you may need to
  read this in order to complete the Exercises)
- [Rules for Java variable names](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables_identifiers.asp)
- (extra) [Declaring multiple Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables_multiple.asp)

**Practice:** Exercises [1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_variables1) -
[4](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_variables4)

---

### Concept: Conditional Statements (`if` and `else`)

#### Tutorials:

- [Java if/else statements](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp)

**Practice:** Exercises [1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_conditions1) -
[4](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_conditions4)

---

### Concept: Functions

#### Tutorials:

- [Java functions](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp) (NOTE: these
  are referred to as 'methods' in the tutorials)
- [Function parameters and return values](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods_param.asp)

**Practice:** Exercises [1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_methods1) -
[5](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_methods5)

---

### Concept: Arrays (storing bundles of values)

Arrays are a way to set up a group of variables of the same type.

#### Tutorial:

- The [w3schools tutorial on arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arrays.asp) covers declaring
  arrays and accessing the elements in them using an index value.

**Practice:**
Array [Exercise 1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_arrays1) through
[Exercise 6](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_arrays6) will provide
good practice with arrays.

---

### Concept: Loops (doing things again)
Loops are a way to do something in code repeatedly until a condition is satisfied.  Loops use the
Java keywords `while`, `do` ... `while`, and two different versions of `for`.

#### Tutorial:

A good review of looping can be found in the w3schools tutorials:

- [Java `while` loop](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp)
- [Java `for` loop](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp)
- Exiting loops early [using `break` and `continue` keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_break.asp)

**Practice:** [Loop Exercise 1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_while_loop1)
through [Loop Exercise 6](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_while_loop6)
will help you practice writing simple loops in a program.

### Concept: Object-oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming is a different way of thinking about how a program is structured than
the procedural (do-one-thing-then-another) programming examples you've probably seen so far.  It's a
topic that requires further explanation and examples to be useful.  But, the tutorial will introduce
some of the fundamental concepts and terminology that can be observed in robot code.

- [Java Object-oriented Programming](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)
- [Java classes and objects](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp)
- [Java class attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_class_attributes.asp) (variables 'inside' a class)
- [Java class methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_class_methods.asp) (functions 'inside' a class)
- [Java constructors](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp)

**Practice:** Exercises [1](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_variables1) -
[4](https://www.w3schools.com/java/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_variables4)
